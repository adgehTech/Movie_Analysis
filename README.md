# Data Analysis on Movies Data

### About the  Data

This analysis includes cleaning data, explanation about the data and answering questions listed at question part.

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters. There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. 

### Questions

- Which genres are most popular from year to year?
- What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?

### Findings

I traversed through data wrangling and exploratory data analysis in the given movie data and I take research to answer asked questions about movie genres, elements driving high revenues, and future projections regarding genre popularity. 
I used Bar charts, scatter, regration line, and correlation matrix to visuallize datas respectively.

Bar charts were used to visually represent the most popular genres for each year, revealing the changing tastes of moviegoers throughout time. To show the links between budget, popularity, runtime, and vote average in relation to income, scatter plots were used. And I used correlation matrix plot of the matplotlib to visualize properties Associated with High Revenues.
 
From this analiysis I found arrays of most popular genres from year to year and strong positive correlations between budget, popularity, and revenue were found by conducting more research on assets associated with large revenues.
