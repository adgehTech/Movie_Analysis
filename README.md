# Data Analysis on Movies Data

### Objective of this analysis

The main objective of this movie data analysis is to visualize the given movie data and to make some findings according to the research questions I raised bellow.

### About the  Data

This analysis includes cleaning data, explanation about the data and answering questions listed at question part.

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters. There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column.

### Questions

- How has the average movie runtime changed over the years, and is there a trend?
- Which genres are most popular from year to year? (Given)
- Visualize the relationship between movie budgets and revenues across different genres and illustrate how budgets and revenues vary within each genre?
- What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues? (Given)
- What genre will be popular in the future years?

### Findings

I traversed through data wrangling and exploratory data analysis in the given movie data and I take research to answer asked questions about movie genres, elements driving high revenues, and future projections regarding genre popularity. 
I used Bar charts, scatter, regression line, and correlation matrix to visualize data respectively.

Bar charts were used to visually represent the most popular genres for each year, revealing the changing tastes of moviegoers throughout time. To show the links between budget, popularity, runtime, and vote average in relation to income, scatter plots were used. And I used correlation matrix plot of the matplotlib to visualize properties Associated with High Revenues.
 
From this analysis I found arrays of most popular genres from year to year and strong positive correlations between budget, popularity, and revenue were found by conducting more research on assets associated with large revenues.

### Technologies

- <b>pandas :</b> Fundamental tool for data preprocessing and exploration.
- <b>numpy :</b> Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these elements.
- <b>matplotlib :</b> Provides a wide variety of plots and charts to visualize data and is often used for creating static, interactive, and animated plots. 
- <b>seaborn :</b> Data visualization library based on Matplotlib, offering additional features and a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- <b>sklearn :</b> Provides functionalities for creating and training machine learning models, including tools for evaluating model performance and selecting hyperparameters.
