    As the project guideline suggests; here my primary objective is to demonstrate the loading of various data types. Therefore, I have loaded .xlsx and .sqlite data, which differs from the .csv format I utilized in the movie analysis.

### Gun data
In addition to some visualization of this data I let answers to the following questions:
- Find and visualize states with Highest Growth in Gun Registrations?
- Find and visualize overall Trend of Gun Purchases?

### Soccer data
In addition to some visualization of this data I let answers to the following questions:
- What teams improved the most over the time period?
- Which players had the most penalties?

### If you need to run this program; 
Create a directory called 'dataset' at root directory then add the following data by downloading it from the given URL below.

- Soccer data
    - <b>URL :</b> https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a0a4cad_database/database.sqlite
    - <b>Local URL :</b> dataset/soccer_data.sqlite
        - Here you need to change the name of the downloaded file to 'soccer_data.sqlite'

- Gun data
    - <b>URL :</b>  https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a0a4db8_gun-data/gun-data.xlsx
    - <b>Local URL :</b> dataset/gun_data.xlsx
