    As the project guideline suggests; here my primary objective is to demonstrate the loading of various data types. Therefore, I have loaded .xlsx and .sqlite data, which differs from the .csv format I utilized in the movie analysis.

### Gun data
In addition to some visualization of this data I let answers to the following questions:
- Find and visualize states with Highest Growth in Gun Registrations?
- Find and visualize overall Trend of Gun Purchases?

### Soccer data
In addition to some visualization of this data I let answers to the following questions:
- What teams improved the most over the time period?
- Which players had the most penalties?
